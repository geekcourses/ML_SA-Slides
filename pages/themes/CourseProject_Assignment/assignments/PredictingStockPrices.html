	<h1>Project Task: Predicting Stock Prices Using Historical Data and Other Features</h1>

	<h2>Overview:</h2>
	<p>This project implements a machine learning model to predict future stock prices based on historical stock prices and other features, such as stock volume, market trends, and news sentiment. It uses a dataset of historical stock prices and features to train and evaluate the model.</p>

	<h2>Data:</h2>
	<p>I use a dataset of historical stock prices and features for a publicly traded company, such as Apple or Amazon. The dataset is freely available on [URL].
		The dataset includes daily stock prices, trading volumes, and other features, such as market trends and news sentiment, for a period of several years. The data is stored in a CSV file, where each row contains: [describe each dataset column].</p>

	<h2>Steps:</h2>

	<h3>Data Preparation:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.</li>
	<li>Clean the data by removing missing values, duplicates, or other irrelevant data.</li>
	<li>Split the dataset into training and testing sets, using a ratio of 80:20 or 70:30.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Feature Engineering:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Calculate additional features that could affect the stock prices, such as moving averages or technical indicators.</li>
		<li>Analyze the correlation between the features and the target variable (i.e., stock prices) to identify the most relevant features.</li>
		<li>Normalize or standardize the features to avoid bias towards any specific feature.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Model Selection and Training:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Experiment with different machine learning models, such as linear regression  or neural networks, to find the best model for your data.</li>
		<li>Train the selected model using the training set and the selected features.</li>
		<li>Evaluate the performance of your model on the testing set, using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Model Optimization:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Experiment with different model hyperparameters, such as learning rate, to improve model performance.</li>
		<li>Use cross-validation to tune the model hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Model Deployment:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the trained model to predict future stock prices for the next few days or weeks.</li>
		<li>Compare your predictions with the actual stock prices to evaluate the accuracy of your model.</li>
		<li>Provide insights into the factors that influence the stock prices and their predictions, such as market trends, news sentiment, or industry events.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Deliverables:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A Jupyter Notebook and/or Python scripts containing your code and analysis, structured well and uploaded in Github as a separate repository.</li>
		<li>A report summarizing your project, including your data preparation steps, feature engineering, model selection and optimization, and results.</li>
		<li>A demo of your model in action, showing how users can input new data and see the predicted stock prices.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Note:</h2>
	This is just a general outline of a project on predicting stock prices, and you can modify it to suit your interests. Good luck with your project!
