    " An image is made up of a grid of pixels, with each pixel representing a specific color. When you view an image on a computer, the pixels are displayed on the screen, creating the visual representation of the image.\n",

    " <img src=\"../images/ImageBitsRepresentation_Black_White-face.png\" alt=\"ImageBitsRepresentation_Black_White\" style=\"height:200px\">\n",

    "OpenCV contains a wide range of refunctions and utilities for image and video processing, including feature detection and extraction, object detection and cognition, and image and video manipulation. It is written in C++ and has bindings for many programming languages, including Python, Java, and C#.\n",

    "OpenCV is widely used in a variety of applications, including robotics, self-driving cars, and security systems. It is a powerful tool for building computer vision applications and can be used in a variety of industries, including \n",

    "### Read an image with OpenCV\n",
    "\n",
    "Next code will read the image file 'number_0.png' and output a NumPy 3D array with dimensions [height, width, channels], where height is the number of rows, width is the number of columns, and channels is the number of color channels (e.g., red, green, and blue).\n",
