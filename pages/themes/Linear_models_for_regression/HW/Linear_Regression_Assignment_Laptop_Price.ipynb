    "## Laptop Price Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Use linear regression to predict laptop prices based on various features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following features:\n",
    "- Company\n",
    "- Product\n",
    "- TypeName\n",
    "- Inches\n",
    "- ScreenResolution\n",
    "- Cpu\n",
    "- Ram\n",
    "- Memory\n",
    "- Gpu\n",
    "- OpSys\n",
    "- Weight\n",
    "- Price\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "2. Explore the data to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable (Price).\n",
    "3. Preprocess the data: handle missing values, if any, and encode categorical variables.\n",
    "4. Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "5. Train a linear regression model using the training data.\n",
    "6. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.\n",
    "7. Make predictions using the trained model and analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Instructions\n",
    "- Ensure to handle any missing values in the dataset.\n",
    "- You may want to visualize the relationships between the features and the target variable using scatter plots.\n",
    "- Experiment with different features and see if you can improve the model's performance.\n",
    "- Write a brief report on your findings and the model's performance.\n"
