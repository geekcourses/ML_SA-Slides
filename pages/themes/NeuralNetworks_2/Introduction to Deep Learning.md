Introduction to Deep Learning:

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that involves training artificial neural networks to perform complex tasks. Deep Learning has gained immense popularity in recent years due to its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.

The key to the success of Deep Learning is its ability to learn hierarchical representations of data. Unlike traditional Machine Learning algorithms that rely on hand-crafted features, Deep Learning algorithms can automatically learn features from raw data by stacking multiple layers of artificial neurons.

Deep Neural Networks are typically trained using large datasets and require a significant amount of computing power. However, with the availability of powerful GPUs and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, training Deep Neural Networks has become more accessible to a wider audience.

Examples in Python:

Let's take a look at some examples of Deep Learning in Python. We will be using the Keras library, which is a high-level API for building and training Deep Neural Networks.

Example 1: Image Classification

In this example, we will build a Deep Neural Network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. We will be using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

```python
import keras
from keras.datasets import cifar10
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Flatten

# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

# Normalize the pixel values between 0 and 1
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255

# Convert the labels to one-hot encoding
num_classes = 10
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)

# Build the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=x_train.shape[1:]))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
batch_size = 128
epochs = 10
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

This code will build and train a CNN with three convolutional layers and two dense layers on the CIFAR-10 dataset for 10 epochs.

Example 2: Natural Language Processing

In this example, we will build a Deep Neural Network to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset, which consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

```python
import keras
from keras.datasets import imdb
from keras.preprocessing import sequence
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Load the IMDB dataset
max_features = 20000
maxlen = 80
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=max
```

\_features)

Pad the sequences to a fixed length
===================================

x\_train = sequence.pad\_sequences(x\_train, maxlen=maxlen)
x\_test = sequence.pad\_sequences(x\_test, maxlen=maxlen)

Build the model
===============

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(max\_features, 128))
model.add(LSTM(128))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

Compile the model
=================

model.compile(loss='binary\_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=\['accuracy'\])

Train the model
===============

batch\_size = 32
epochs = 5
model.fit(x\_train, y\_train, batch\_size=batch\_size, epochs=epochs, validation\_data=(x\_test, y\_test))

```

This code will build and train a Deep Neural Network with an Embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense layer on the IMDB dataset for 5 epochs.
