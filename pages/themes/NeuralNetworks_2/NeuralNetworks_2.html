<section class="sub-sections"><h2>Introduction to Deep Learning</h2>
	<section><h3>Overview</h3>
		<img src="./images/deep-neural-network.jpg" alt="deep-neural-network.jpg">
		<dl class="fa">
			<dt>Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that involves training artificial neural networks to perform complex tasks.</dt>
			<dt>Deep learning is called so because it involves the use of deep neural networks, which are composed of multiple hidden layers.</dt>
			<dt>These networks can be very deep, with dozens or even hundreds of layers, which allows them to learn highly complex representations of data.</dt>
		</dl>

	</section>
	<section>
		<dl class="fa"><h3>Applications</h3>
			<dt>Deep Learning has gained immense popularity in recent years due to its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks such as <span class="note">image recognition</span>, <span class="note">natural language processing</span>, <span class="note">speech recognition</span>, and more.</dt>
			<dt>Deep Neural Networks are typically trained using large datasets and require a significant amount of computing power. However, with the availability of powerful GPUs and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, training Deep Neural Networks has become more accessible to a wider audience.</dt>
		</dl>
	</section>
	<section><h3>How it works</h3>
		<dl class="fa">
			<dt>Unlike traditional Machine Learning algorithms that rely on hand-crafted features, Deep Learning algorithms <span class="note">can automatically learn features from raw data</span> by stacking multiple layers of artificial neurons.</dt>
			<dt>For example, let's say we wanted to build a system to recognize images of cats and dogs. In the first layer of the neural network, the neurons might learn to detect low-level features like edges and corners. In the next layer, the neurons might learn to detect higher-level features like fur and whiskers. In the final layer, the neurons might learn to classify the images as either cats or dogs based on the presence of these features.</dt>
		</dl>
	</section>
	<section><h3>Deep Learning Advantages</h3>
		<dl class="fa">
			<dt><span class="note">High accuracy</span>: DL models can achieve high accuracy on a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. They can learn complex representations of data that other machine learning models may struggle with.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Feature extraction</span>: DL models can automatically learn useful features from raw data, eliminating the need for feature engineering, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Flexibility</span>: DL models are highly flexible and can be used for a wide range of tasks, from classification and regression to image and speech synthesis.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Scalability</span>: DL models can scale up to handle large datasets and complex architectures. This makes it possible to build and train models that would be impossible to develop using traditional machine learning techniques.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Adaptability</span>: DL models can adapt to new data and new situations, making them useful for applications that need to respond to changing circumstances.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Automation</span>: DL models can automate complex tasks, such as speech recognition or image recognition, making it possible to build intelligent systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intervention.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Interdisciplinary</span>: DL is an interdisciplinary field that draws on expertise from computer science, mathematics, statistics, and neuroscience, making it a rich and vibrant area of research and development.</dt>
		</dl>
	</section>
	<section><h3>Deep Learning Disadvantages</h3>
		<dl class="fa">
			<dt><span class="note">Black box nature</span>: DL models can be difficult to interpret and understand. That makes it difficult to diagnose errors or understand how the model is making decisions. </dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Large amounts of data</span>: DL requires large amounts of data to train models effectively. This can be challenging for companies or organizations that don't have access to large datasets.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Computational resources</span>: DL requires significant computational resources, including high-end CPUs, GPUs, and specialized hardware like TPUs. This can be expensive and can limit the ability of some organizations to use DL effectively.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Overfitting</span>: DL models can be prone to overfitting, which means that they may perform well on training data but poorly on new data.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Requires specialized knowledge</span>: DL developers must have deep understanding of programming, mathematics, and statistics</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Limited data efficiency</span>: DL is not efficient with smaller datasets and can overfit quickly. This can lead to poor model generalization and high variance.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Slow training time</span>: DL models can take a long time to train, especially when working with large datasets or complex architectures</dt>

		</dl>
	</section>
	<section><h3>Keras backends</h3>
		<dl class="fa">
			<dt>Keras does not handle itself low-level operations such as tensor products, convolutions and so on. Instead, it relies on a specialized, well-optimized tensor manipulation library to do so, serving as the "backend engine" of Keras.</dt>
			<dt>Keras modular design allows several different backend engines to be plugged seamlessly.</dt>
			<dt>Currently (February, 2023), Keras has two backend implementations available: the TensorFlow backend and the Theano backend.</dt>
			<dd>TensorFlow is an open-source symbolic tensor manipulation framework developed by Google, Inc.</dd>
			<dd>Theano is an open-source symbolic tensor manipulation framework developed by LISA/MILA Lab at Université de Montréal.</dd>
		</dl>
	</section>
	<section><h3>Keras Advantages</h3>
		<dl class="fa">

		</dl>
	</section>
	<section><h3>Keras Disadvantages</h3>
		<p>Keras is an abstraction layer over TensorFlow , designed to be easy to use and beginner friendly. While this is a plus for new developers, it leads to some disadvantages: </p>
		<dl class="fa">
			<dt><span class="note">Limited flexibility</span>: Keras have less control over the underlying architecture and may not be able to customize it as much as you would like</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Less transparent debugging</span>: Using Keras is harder to understand what is happening under the hood when debugging. This can be frustrating for developers who want more visibility into the internals of their models.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Less efficient performance</span>: Because Keras is built on top of other deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or Theano, it may not be as optimized for performance as other libraries that are designed specifically for performance.</dt>
			<dt><span class="note">Limited support for research</span>: While Keras is a great tool for building and deploying production-grade models, it may not be the best choice for cutting-edge research. This is because Keras has a limited set of modules and may not support the latest research breakthroughs as quickly as other, more research-focused libraries.</dt>
