# Project Task: Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

## Overview:
You will build a machine learning model to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. You will use a dataset of customer reviews and their associated sentiment labels to train and evaluate your model. Finally, you will use your model to classify new customer reviews and interpret the results.

## Data:
You will use a dataset of customer reviews from a fictional online retailer. The dataset includes 10,000 reviews, each labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Tasks:

### Data Preparation:
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Clean the text data by removing punctuation, stop words, and other irrelevant words.
Convert the text data into a numerical representation, such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF vectors.

### Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier or a Support Vector Machine (SVM), using the training set.
Evaluate the performance of your model on the testing set, using appropriate metrics.

### Model Optimization:
Experiment with different model hyper-parameters to improve model performance.
Use cross-validation to tune the model hyper-parameters and avoid overfitting.

### Model Deployment:
Use the trained model to classify new customer reviews and assign a sentiment label.


## Deliverables:

A Jupyter Notebook containing your code and analysis.
A report summarizing your project, including your data preparation steps, model selection and optimization, and results.
A demo of your model in action.

## Note:
This is just a general outline of a project on sentiment analysis, and you can modify it to suit your interests. Good luck with your project!
